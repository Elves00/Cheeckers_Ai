# Cheeckers_Ai

This is an in-progress repository

This repository seeks to create a playable game of Chinese Checkers with several implemented bots which the player can compete against. The intention is to have a range of bots which implement different versions of searches such as minimax or monte Carlo in order to play semi intelligently versus a human opponent or another bot.

## Instalation
Simply run the guiMove.py file in visual studio code or other editor.
